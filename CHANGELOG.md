# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes. Versions follow semantic versioning;
0.x while the app is finding its shape.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

First shareable build. Everything below is new.

### Ingest
- Card detection on mount, Ingest in its own window, day chips, a live
  example of the names the templates will produce, MB/s and time left.
- Templates with Photo Mechanic's variable names plus camera, time, weekday,
  folder, destination and ingest-day variables; persistent `{seqn}` per
  headline.
- SHA-256 verification of every copy at every destination; a ledger so a
  card is never copied twice; `-1, -2` suffix option; eject when verified.
- Keep the card's folders; copy voice memos and sidecars; a backup
  destination; GPS for every photo; the sheet opens while the copy runs.
- Live Ingest: a watched folder, files picked up once their size settles.

### Cull
- Ratings, colour classes, tags, filters, sort, tabs, undo.
- Preview fit and 1:1 with one shared magnification, compare up to four,
  loupe, view-only exposure boost, burst stacks.
- Rotate and crop stored in the sidecar and applied on export, with ratio
  presets and thirds or golden-section guides.

### Caption

  chips with recent values, GPS, Title, Caption writer, Instructions,
  Transmission reference, Save & next, Save to selection, copy and paste
  metadata.

### Export and delivery

  naming templates, presets per outlet.
- Delivery to a folder, FTP, FTPS or SFTP; passwords in the macOS Keychain;
  three tries per file; a per-photo sent ledger in the inspector; resend
  failed.

### App
- Two appearances with a lavender accent, Reduce Motion, text scaling,
  higher contrast, keyboard focus rings, every function in a menu.

  detection, a menu bar extra with live status, About with notices, a log
  file, versioned settings with a damaged-file backup.

### Known limitations

  sign-in are not built (use their desktop sync folder with a Folder target).
- JPEG XL needs Homebrew's jpeg-xl installed.
- Rotation and crop are applied on export, not shown as a crop on the sheet.
- macOS only.
